## Overview
This repository contains comprehensive documentation on agentic design patterns for building intelligent AI systems using Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Language / 언어
- **English**: Full documentation available
- **한국어 (Korean)**: 전체 문서 한글 번역본 제공

## Chapters

### 1. Prompt Chaining
- [English](./Chapter-1-Prompt-Chaining.md) | [한국어](./Chapter-1-Prompt-Chaining.ko.md)
- Breaking down complex tasks into sequential, manageable steps where the output of one prompt serves as input for the next.

### 2. Routing
- [English](./Chapter-2-Routing.md) | [한국어](./Chapter-2-Routing.ko.md)
- Dynamically directing queries to specialized agents or workflows based on input characteristics.

### 3. Parallelization
- [English](./Chapter-3-Parallelization.md) | [한국어](./Chapter-3-Parallelization.ko.md)
- Executing multiple independent tasks simultaneously to improve performance and efficiency.

### 4. Reflection
- [English](./Chapter-4-Reflection.md) | [한국어](./Chapter-4-Reflection.ko.md)
- Implementing self-evaluation and iterative improvement mechanisms for higher quality outputs.

### 5. Tool Use
- [English](./Chapter-5-Tool-Use.md) | [한국어](./Chapter-5-Tool-Use.ko.md)
- Enabling agents to interact with external tools, APIs, and systems to extend their capabilities.

### 6. Planning
- [English](./Chapter-6-Planning.md) | [한국어](./Chapter-6-Planning.ko.md)
- Decomposing complex goals into structured plans with multiple steps and adaptive execution.

### 7. Multi-Agent Collaboration
- [English](./Chapter-7-Multi-Agent-Collaboration.md) | [한국어](./Chapter-7-Multi-Agent-Collaboration.ko.md)
- Coordinating multiple specialized agents to work together on complex tasks.

## Visual Diagrams

Each chapter includes Mermaid diagrams to visualize the patterns. These diagrams are stored in the `images/` directory organized by chapter.

## Key Concepts

- **Context Engineering**: Building comprehensive informational environments for AI agents
- **Agent Orchestration**: Managing and coordinating multiple agents effectively
- **Tool Integration**: Seamlessly connecting agents with external capabilities
- **Iterative Improvement**: Using feedback loops to enhance output quality

## Implementation Examples

The documentation includes practical code examples using frameworks like:
- LangChain
- LangGraph
- Crew AI
- Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)

## Getting Started

1. Start with [Chapter 1: Prompt Chaining](./Chapter-1-Prompt-Chaining.md) to understand the fundamentals
2. Progress through each chapter sequentially for a comprehensive understanding
3. Review the visual diagrams to grasp the architectural patterns
4. Experiment with the provided code examples

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Familiarity with Python programming
- Knowledge of API integration concepts
